Raptors is a simple genetic algorithm that solves a problem similar to those 
outlined in https://www.xkcd.com/135/ however here the scenario is as follows:

The raptor is at (10,0) meters and you are at (0,0) meters. The raptor will
always accelerate toward you at 20 m/s^2 with a max speed of 25 m/s while you 
will accelerate in your current direction at 5.2 m/s^2 with a max speed of 
6 m/s. There is a global velocity extinction rate (drag) of 0.8 meaning that 
your velocity would decreasy by 80% in one second if you did not accelerate.

In this model, your current direction is defined by a sequence of Actions which
are either NONE, LEFT, or RIGHT. Each timestep of the simulation has an action
associated with it. 
NONE - keep the curent direction
LEFT - turn left by 90deg
RIGHT - turn right by 90deg

It may not seem to be the case, but this actually produces "realistic" paths.

A generation of the simulation consists of some number of samples which 
correspond to different sequences of actions you may take. Each sample is 
simulated to calculate the survival time given by when the raptor is less than 
10cm from your location. Then some percent of slowest paths are elimated and 
the generation is repopulated with surviving paths and mutations of those 
paths. A mutated path is a duplicate of a path with between 1 and 5 random 
action substitutions at random points in the sequence. Each surviving path gets 
roughly an equal number of mutated offspring.

The included Mathematica notebook vis.nb will generate gif images of the 25
most successful paths for generations which can be combined into animated gifs.
